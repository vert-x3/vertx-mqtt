= Vert.x MQTT server

This component provides a server which is able to handle connections, communication and messages exchange with remote
link:http://mqtt.org/[MQTT] clients. Its API provides a bunch of events related to raw protocol messages received by
clients and exposes some features in order to send messages to them.

It's not a fully featured MQTT broker but can be used for building something like that or for protocol translation.

WARNING: this module has the tech preview status, this means the API can change between versions.

== Getting Started

=== Handling client connection/disconnection

This example shows how it's possible to handle the connection request from a remote MQTT client. First, an
{@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServer} instance is created and the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServer#endpointHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method is used to specify the handler called
when a remote client sends a CONNECT message for connecting to the server itself. The {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint}
instance, provided as parameter to the handler, brings all main information related to the CONNECT message like client identifier,
username/password, "will" information, clean session flag, protocol version and the "keep alive" timeout.
Inside that handler, the _endpoint_ instance provides the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#accept(boolean)} method
for replying to the remote client with the corresponding CONNACK message : in this way, the connection is established.
Finally, the server is started using the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServer#listen(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method with
the default behavior (on localhost and default MQTT port 1883). The same method allows to specify an handler in order
to check if the server is started properly or not.

{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example1}
----

The same _endpoint_ instance provides the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#disconnectHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)}
for specifying the handler called when the remote client sends a DISCONNECT message in order to disconnect from the server;
this handler takes no parameters.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example2}
----

=== Handling client connection/disconnection with SSL/TLS support

The server has the support for accepting connection requests through the SSL/TLS protocol for authentication and encryption.
In order to do that, the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServerOptions} class provides the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServerOptions#setSsl(boolean)} method
for setting the usage of SSL/TLS (passing 'true' as value) and some other useful methods for providing server certificate and
related private key (as Java key store reference, PEM or PFX format). In the following example, the
{@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServerOptions#setKeyCertOptions(io.vertx.core.net.KeyCertOptions)} method is used in order to
pass the certificates in PEM format. This method requires an instance of the possible implementations of the
{@link io.vertx.core.net.KeyCertOptions} interface and in this case the {@link io.vertx.core.net.PemKeyCertOptions} class
is used in order to provide the path for the server certificate and the private key with the correspondent
{@link io.vertx.core.net.PemKeyCertOptions#setCertPath(java.lang.String)} and
{@link io.vertx.core.net.PemKeyCertOptions#setKeyPath(java.lang.String)} methods.
The MQTT server is started passing the Vert.x instance as usual and the above MQTT options instance to the creation method.

=== Handling client connections via WebSocket

If you want to support connections via WebSockets, you can enable this via {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServerOptions},
too. By passing `true` to {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServerOptions#setUseWebSocket(boolean)}, it will listen for
websocket connections on the path `/mqtt`.

As with other setup configurations, the resulting endpoint connections and related disconnection are managed the same
way as regular connections.

----
{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example11}
----

=== Handling client subscription/unsubscription request

After a connection is established between client and server, the client can send a subscription request for a topic
using the SUBSCRIBE message. The {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint} interface allows to specify an handler for the
incoming subscription request using the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#subscribeHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method.
Such handler receives an instance of the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.messages.MqttSubscribeMessage} interface which brings
the list of topics with related QoS levels as desired by the client.
Finally, the endpoint instance provides the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#subscribeAcknowledge(int, java.util.List)} method
for replying to the client with the related SUBACK message containing the granted QoS levels.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example4}
----

In the same way, it's possible to use the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#unsubscribeHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method
on the endpoint in order to specify the handler called when the client sends an UNSUBSCRIBE message. This handler receives
an instance of the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.messages.MqttUnsubscribeMessage} interface as parameter with the list of topics to unsubscribe.
Finally, the endpoint instance provides the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#unsubscribeAcknowledge(int)} method
for replying to the client with the related UNSUBACK message.

[source,$lang]

{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example5}

=== Handling client published message

In order to handle incoming messages published by the remote client, the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint} interface provides
the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method for specifying the handler called
when the client sends a PUBLISH message. This handler receives an instance of the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.messages.MqttPublishMessage}
interface as parameter with the payload, the QoS level, the duplicate and retain flags.

If the QoS level is 0 (AT_MOST_ONCE), there is no need from the endpoint to reply the client.

If the QoS level is 1 (AT_LEAST_ONCE), the endpoind needs to reply with a PUBACK message using the
available {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishAcknowledge(int)} method.

If the QoS level is 2 (EXACTLY_ONCE), the endpoint needs to reply with a PUBREC message using the
available {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishReceived(int)} method; in this case the same endpoint should handle
the PUBREL message received from the client as well (the remote client sends it after receiving the PUBREC from the endpoint)
and it can do that specifying the handler through the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishReleaseHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method.
In order to close the QoS level 2 delivery, the endpoint can use the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishComplete(int)} method
for sending the PUBCOMP message to the client.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example6}
----

=== Publish message to the client

The endpoint can publish a message to the remote client (sending a PUBLISH message) using the
{@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publish(java.lang.String, io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer, io.netty.handler.codec.mqtt.MqttQoS, boolean, boolean)} method
which takes the following input parameters : the topic to publish, the payload, the QoS level, the duplicate and retain flags.

If the QoS level is 0 (AT_MOST_ONCE), the endpoint won't receiving any feedback from the client.

If the QoS level is 1 (AT_LEAST_ONCE), the endpoint needs to handle the PUBACK message received from the client
in order to receive final acknowledge of delivery. It's possible using the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishAcknowledgeHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method
specifying such an handler.

If the QoS level is 2 (EXACTLY_ONCE), the endpoint needs to handle the PUBREC message received from the client.
The {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishReceivedHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method allows to specify
the handler for that. Inside that handler, the endpoint can use the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishRelease(int)} method
for replying to the client with the PUBREL message. The last step is to handle the PUBCOMP message received from the client
as final acknowledge for the published message; it's possible using the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#publishCompletionHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)}
for specifying the handler called when the final PUBCOMP message is received.

=== Be notified by client keep alive

The underlying MQTT keep alive mechanism is handled by the server internally. When the CONNECT message is received,
the server takes care of the keep alive timeout specified inside that message in order to check if the client doesn't
send messages in such timeout. At same time, for every PINGREQ received, the server replies with the related PINGRESP.

Even if there is no need for the high level application to handle that, the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint} interface
provides the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttEndpoint#pingHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method for specifying an handler
called when a PINGREQ message is received from the client. It's just a notification to the application that the client
isn't sending meaningful messages but only pings for keeping alive; in any case the PINGRESP is automatically sent
by the server internally as described above.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example8}
----

=== Closing the server

The {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServer} interface provides the {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttServer#close(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method
that can be used for closing the server; it stops to listen for incoming connections and closes all the active connections
with remote clients. This method is asynchronous and one overload provides the possibility to specify a complention handler
that will be called when the server is really closed.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example9}
----

=== Automatic clean-up in verticles

If you’re creating MQTT servers from inside verticles, those servers will be automatically closed when the verticle is undeployed.

=== Scaling : sharing MQTT servers

The handlers related to the MQTT server are always executed in the same event loop thread. It means that on a system with
more cores, only one instance is deployed so only one core is used. In order to use more cores, it's possible to deploy
more instances of the MQTT server.

It's possible to do that programmatically:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example10}
----

or using a verticle specifying the number of instances:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttServerExamples#example11}
----

What's really happen is that even only MQTT server is deployed but as incoming connections arrive, Vert.x distributes
them in a round-robin fashion to any of the connect handlers executed on different cores.

= Vert.x MQTT client

This component provides an link:http://mqtt.org/[MQTT] client which is compliant with the 3.1.1 spec. Its API provides a bunch of methods
for connecting/disconnecting to a broker, publishing messages (with all three different levels of QoS) and subscribing to topics.

WARNING: this module has the tech preview status, this means the API can change between versions.

== Getting started

=== Connect/Disconnect
The client gives you opportunity to connect to a server and disconnect from it.
Also, you could specify things like the host and port of a server you would like
to connect to passing instance of {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClientOptions} as a param through constructor.

This example shows how you could connect to a server and disconnect from it using Vert.x MQTT client
and calling {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#connect(int, java.lang.String, io.vertx.core.Handler)} and {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#disconnect()} methods.
[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttClientExamples#example1}
----
NOTE: default address of server provided by {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClientOptions} is localhost:1883 and localhost:8883 if you are using SSL/TSL.

=== Subscribe to a topic

Now, lest go deeper and take look at this example:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttClientExamples#example2}
----

Here we have the example of usage of {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#subscribe(java.lang.String, int)} method. In order to receive messages from rpi2/temp topic we call {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#subscribe(java.lang.String, int)} method.
Although, to handle received messages from server you need to provide a handler, which will be called each time you have a new messages in the topics you subscribe on.
As this example shows, handler could be provided via {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#publishHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} method.

=== Publishing message to a topic

If you would like to publish some message into topic then {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#publish(java.lang.String, io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer, io.netty.handler.codec.mqtt.MqttQoS, boolean, boolean)} should be called.
Let's take a look at the example:
[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.VertxMqttClientExamples#example3}
----
In the example we send message to topic with name "temperature".

=== Keep connection with server alive
In order to keep connection with server you should time to time send something to server otherwise server will close the connection.
The right way to keep connection alive is a {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#ping()} method.

IMPORTANT: by default you client keep connections with server automatically. That means that you don't need to call {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#ping()} in order to keep connections with server.
The {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient} will do it for you.

If you want to disable this feature then you should call {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClientOptions#setAutoKeepAlive(boolean)} with `false` as argument:
[source,$lang]

{@link examples.VertxMqttClientExamples#example4}
----

=== Be notified when
* publish is completed
+
You could provide handler by calling {@link io.vertx.mqtt.MqttClient#publishCompletionHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)}. The handler will be called each time publish is completed.
This one is pretty useful because you could see the packetId of just received PUBACK or PUBCOMP packet.

WARNING: The handler WILL NOT BE CALLED if sent publish packet with QoS=0.
