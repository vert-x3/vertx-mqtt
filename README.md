# Vert.x MQTT

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vert-x3/vertx-mqtt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vert-x3/vertx-mqtt)

This project provides the following two different components :

* **server** : it's able to handle connections, communication and messages exchange with remote [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) clients.
Its API provides a bunch of events related to raw protocol messages received by clients and exposes some functionalities in order to send messages to them.
It's not a fully featured MQTT broker but can be used for building something like that or for protocol translation (MQTT <--> ?).
* **client** : it's an [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) client which is compliant with the 3.1.1 spec. Its API provides a bunch of methods
for connecting/disconnecting to a broker, publishing messages (with all three different levels of QoS) and subscribing to topics.

See the in-source docs for more details:
- [Website](http://vertx.io/docs/#mqtt).
- [Sources](src/main/asciidoc/index.adoc).

Some examples are available for getting started with the server under the [vertx-examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/master/mqtt-server-examples) project.

## Running tests

Run all tests. The client is tested with the `mqtt.eclipse.org` server.

```
> mvn verify
```

Run all tests. The client is tested with a Docker container started by Maven on the `1884` port

```
> mvn verify -Plocal_test
```

Like above but with an manual Docker container start/stop.

```
> docker run -d -p 1884:1883 ansi/mosquitto
> mvn verify -Dmqtt.server.host=localhost -Dmqtt.server.port=1884
```
